## Research Question

**Can class-conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) generate synthetic satellite images that improve classification performance on small datasets like EuroSAT, compared to traditional data augmentation methods?**

---

##  Abstract

This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of synthetic satellite images generated via DDPMs for augmenting low-resource classification datasets. Using the EuroSAT dataset and a ResNet-18 classifier, we compare synthetic data augmentation to standard geometric transformations across multiple data sizes (100%, 50%, 10%).

Key finding: While geometric augmentations consistently improved performance, synthetic augmentation often reduced accuracy unless used sparingly or in hybrid combinations with traditional methods. Notably, hybrid augmentation improved performance for certain land cover classes like *Annual Crop*.
